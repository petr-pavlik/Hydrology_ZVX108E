    "text": "Introduction\nThe ZVX108E Hydrology taught at the Czech University of Life Sciences is an introductory undergraduate course with students of various scientific background, many of whom do not possess knowledge of any programming language yet. Hence we introduce the R programming language which serves for decades as a great tool for scientific data processing, statistical evaluation, visualization and reporting. The choice of R over other tools is opinionated. R is told to be “developed by statisticians for statisticians” and such as fits perfectly well into the workflow of hydrological data processing. We believe it is more straightforward to learn than Python and does not main students with plethora of environments and incomparable versions. There is a saying “Python is the second best language for everything” and we as authors fully agree. Since the course only contains six practical sessions, oriented to various parts of hydrology, we focus on the basic and merit.\nThis text was created with the use of 4.2.2 and namespaces of following packages:\nReproduction of all the materials should be possible using the same versions."

    "text": "2.2 R as programming language\n\n2.2.1 Name conventions\nIt is possible. We highly discourage using interpunction in naming, like the Czech translation of the term “variable” - proměnná. Most programmers use either camelNotation or snake_notation for naming purposes. Obviously the R is case-sensitive so camelNotation and CamelNotation are two different things.\n\n\n2.2.2 Functions\nYou can define own functions using the function() construct. If you work in RStudio, just type fun and tabulate a snippet from the IDE help, which produces:\n\n\nCode\nname <- function(variables) {\n  \n}\n\n\nname is the name of the function we would like to create and variables are the arguments of that function. Space between the {and } is called a body of a function and contains all the computation which is invoked when the function is called.\nLet’s put Here an example of creating own function to calculate weighted mean\n\\[\n\\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_iw_i,\n\\] where \\(x_iw_i\\) are the individual weighted measurements.\nWe define a simple function with\n\n\nCode\nw_mean <- function(x, w = 1/length(x)) {\n  1/1/length(x)*sum(x)\n}\nw_mean(1:10)\n\n\n[1] 5.5\n\n\nWe can test if we get the same result as the primitive function from R using all.equal() statement.\n\n\nCode\nall.equal(w_mean(1:10), mean(1:10))\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Vectors\nAtomic vectors are single-type linear structures. They can contain elements of any type, from logical, integer, numeric, complex, character.\n\n\nCode\nV <- vector(mode = \"numeric\", length = 0) # empty vector creation\nV[1] <- \n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Matrices and arrays\n\n\nCode\nM <- matrix(0, nrow = 1, ncol = 1) # empty matrix creation\nM[1, 1] <- 1  # add single value at origin\nM[, 1] <- 0 \nM[1, 0] <- 0 \n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Data frames\ndata.frame structure is the workhorse of elementary data processing. It is a possibly heterogenic table-like structure, allowing storage of multiple data types (even other structures) in different columns. A column in any data frame is called a variable and row represents a single observation. If the data suffice this single condition, we say they are in tidy format. Processing tidy data is a big topic withing the R community and curious reader is encouraged to follow the development in tidyverse package ecosystem.\n\n\nCode\nstreamflow <- data.frame() # empty data.frame creation\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Lists\n\n\nCode\nl <- list() # empty list creation \n\n\n\n\n2.2.7 Other objects\nAlthough R is intended as functional programming language, more than one object oriented paradigm is implemented in the language. As new R users we encounter first OOP system in functions like summary and plot, which represent so called S3 generic functions. We will further work with S4 system when processing geospatial data using proxy libraries like sf and terra. The OOP is very complex and will not be further discussed within this text. For further study we recommend OOP sections in Advanced R by Hadley Wickham."

There are some data sets.\nLet’s take a look at data from CAMELS (Addor et al. 2017) at https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/camels.html. It is a curated large sample data set, which was produced by the UCAR with the intention to\nThis dataset covers the same 671 catchments as the Large-Sample Hydrometeorological Dataset introduced by Newman et al. (2015). For each catchment, we characterized a wide range of attributes that influence catchment behavior and hydrological processes. Datasets characterizing these attributes have been available separately for some time, but comprehensive multivariate catchment scale assessments have so far been difficult, because these datasets typically have different spatial configurations, are stored in different archives, or use different data formats. By creating catchment scale estimates of these attributes, our aim is to simplify the assessment of their interrelationships.\nTopographic characteristics (e.g. elevation and slope) were retrieved from Newman et al. (2015). Climatic indices (e.g., aridity and frequency of dry days) and hydrological signatures (e.g., mean annual discharge and baseflow index) were computed using the time series provided by Newman et al. (2015). Soil characteristics (e.g., porosity and soil depth) were characterized using the STATSGO dataset and the Pelletier et al. (2016) dataset. Vegetation characteristics (e.g. the leaf area index and the rooting depth) were inferred using MODIS data. Geological characteristics (e.g., geologic class and the subsurface porosity) were computed using the GLiM and GLHYMPS datasets.\n\n\nCode\n#ts <- readr::read_csv(\"data/\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddor, N., A.
