# SCS CN

The SCS curve number (CN) is a method developed in ... [^05_cn-1] CN helps with the estimation of runoff at basins where no runoff has been measured. 

We have to start with some initial data.

$$
\dfrac{F}{S} = \dfrac{Q}{P-I_a}
$$

$$
I_a = 0.2\cdot S
$$

$$
S = \dfrac{1000}{\mathrm{CN}}
$$
where $S$ is a potential maximum retention after the initial runoff.


$$
Q = \dfrac{(P-I_a)^2}{(P-I_a)+S}
$$
